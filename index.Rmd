### Create a repo

* To create a personal website: `<YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io`
* General format for links: `[text for link](address.of.link)`
* Websites has more than another page: create another RMD file with `html` output and link it to the home page RMD file.html.
* To include images:
  * `![](image.jpg)`
  * `<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">`: better option (usually keep images inside `images` folder, `style` components control image height, width, etc)


### `_site.yml`
Create a `_site.yml` file by going to File > New File > Text file and save as `_site.yml`.

* Controls the structure and appearance of the website. It provides configuration options for the website's layout, navigation, styling, and other settings.
* Check `_site.yml` file in this project folder for reference.
  * Use `icons`: an easy way for someone to email you, and a link to the source for the site on GitHub. ([check for more icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons))

### Template 
Use `website_template` folder to create a website.

### R project
To build the webite that has multiple RMD pages:
Go to `Build` in Environment pane > Click on  `Build Website`

### Hosting on Github
Sometimes you have to update the repo settings for GitHub to know this is a website, especially for websites that are not `<YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io`:

* Make sure youâ€™ve pushed what you have to GitHub
* Log in to GitHub, find the repo, and navigate to repo settings
* Set the GitHub pages source to the main branch
